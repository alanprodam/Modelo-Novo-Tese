  Abstract                 = {In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, flexible trajectory generation algorithms are required to enable high levels of autonomy for critical mission phases, such as take-off, area coverage, and landing. In this paper, we present a guidance approach which uses the improved intrinsic tau guidance theory to create spatio-temporal 4-D trajectories for a desired time-to-contact with a landing platform tracked by a visual sensor. This allows us to perform maneuvers with tunable trajectory profiles, while catering for static or non-static starting and terminating motion states. We validate our method in both simulations and real platform experiments by using rotary-wing UAVs to land on static platforms. Results show that our method achieves smooth landings within 10Â cm accuracy, with easily adjustable trajectory parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a completely autonomous solution to participate in the Indoor Challenge of the 2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Competition (IMAV 2013). Our proposal is a multi-robot system with no centralized coordination whose robotic agents share their position estimates. The capability of each agent to navigate avoiding collisions is a consequence of the resulting emergent behavior. Each agent consists of a ground station running an instance of the proposed architecture that communicates over WiFi with an AR Drone 2.0 quadrotor. Visual markers are employed to sense and map obstacles and to improve the pose estimation based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and ground optical flow data. Based on our architecture, each robotic agent can navigate avoiding obstacles and other members of the multi-robot system. The solution is demonstrated and the achieved navigation performance is evaluated by means of experimental flights. This work also analyzes the capabilities of the presented solution in simulated flights of the IMAV 2013 Indoor Challenge. The performance of the CVG{\_}UPM team was awarded with the First Prize in the Indoor Autonomy Challenge of the IMAV 2013 competition.},
