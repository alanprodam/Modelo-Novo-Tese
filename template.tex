\begin{abstract}
In 2009, over 56 million liters of fuel were used to overcome friction in combustion engines, being the bearings alone accountable for nearly a quarter of this loss. This research aims to numerically model a lightweight crankshaft bearing and to study the effects that surface textures can have on its performance, aiming to reduce friction in this component.  A literature review was performed, covering the surface texture treatments, lubrication regimes and aspects of rough contact and temperature. A computer program was developed to study the behavior of a dynamically loaded bearing, considering roughness effects on lubrication, asperity contact, global thermal effects and surface texturing. Simulations were performed for the bearing of a lightweight crankshaft, considering different texture designs on its surface. The results showed that it is possible to reduce the mean and maximum hydrodynamic friction coefficient of these bearings, but some texture designs may lead to an increase in the fluid pressure, specially when the thermal effects are take into account.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
This work aims to develop procedures for virtual texturing of crankshaft bearings to improve their performance in terms of friction and load carrying capacity. There is an ever-increasing demand for automobiles worldwide and enhancing the tribological properties of engine components is important since nearly one third of the fuel energy is used to overcome friction \cite{Holmberg2012}. According to the author, only in 2009, 208,000 millions of liters of fuel were used to overcome friction, and, as gasoline is a nonrenewable power source and, therefore, has a limited life cycle, the amount of money wasted due to friction is only increasing. If would be possible to reduce the amount of friction in crankshaft bearings, it is possible to reduce the amount of gasoline required to provide the same power to the engine and, as a result,  increase the vehicle efficiency, allowing it to run with lower costs.

In a regular four-stroke engine, gasoline works in an intake-compression-combustion-exhaust cycle, performed using mechanical components. About 28$\%$ of the energy fuel, without considering braking friction, is lost due to friction. Lubrication is important to reduce friction on these mechanical parts, but for a bearing, even when lubricated, the friction still represents about 25$\%$ of the power loss in engines \cite{Ligier2015}.      

Researches were performed in mechanical seals and concluded that it is possible to reduce friction in seals by modifying their surfaces. In this study, performed by Etsion and Burstein, they added dimples to the seal surface and improved the component's performance, for an optimum set up. With those modifications, there was a friction reduction up to 50\% \cite{Etsion1996}. This research led to questions about whether it is possible to reproduce this results for different engine components. If so, the amount of energy lost due to friction in engine components would fall drastically, improving the vehicles' power efficiency.
